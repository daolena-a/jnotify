= FSEvents API limitations =
The FSEvents API only provides notifications that directory content has changed,
not what has changed, and these notifications can be delayed about a second.
Because of this, JNotify on Mac OS X cannot reliably detect changes that are on
disk for less than a second. For example, `mv a b ; mv b c` may be reported as
'a' being renamed to 'b' being renamed to 'c', or just 'a' being renamed to 'c'.

Because of the latency, `mv a b ; mv d e ; mv b c` will most likely be reported as 'a' being renamed to 'c' followed by 'd' being renamed to 'e'.

JNotify on Mac OS X also cannot detect when something is moved into or out of
the watch directory. Files moved in will appear as created, and files moved out
will appear as deleted.

If you do not depend on the exact reporting of such events, this will not be a
problem for you.
